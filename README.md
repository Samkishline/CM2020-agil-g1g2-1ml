Project Idea: A.I. Workout Application

Why is it unique?
The application instead of listening to songs which could very inconveniently end just when you need a final push during your run, would instead be generated based on both the users current heartbeat and gait using AI.

Crowded marketplace?
The application would be one of the only music applications which do not require an active subscription and allow the user to listen to music offline using no data.

Is it really unique?
Though I’ve heard of AI generated music like Jukebox.ai, i’ve never heard of this technology being coupled with heartbeat/gait to generate music BPM based on your current running speed/workout level.

The Project Introduction to our project? Name for the app?

After an ideation phase where each of us came up with a few different app ideas, we had a vote and decided to start creating a workout app which utilises some AI functionality to compose music that matches the user’s heart rate in order to create a fulfilling and smooth workout flow.


1) A clearly defined set of deliverable components of the software and the job of 
work required to bring these components to completion.
Text

2) The defined timescale of work, including any dependencies, milestones or 
contingencies.
Text

3) A formal specification of the desired system (e.g. UML, technical and functional specification)
Text

4) A clearly defined scope for the project.
Text

5) Some evidence of requirements elicitation involving some/all of your project
stakeholders. 

Stakeholders for this project consists of the four members in the project group; Heng, Ken, Saana and Sam (in alphabetical order). As the leader of the group, Heng managed meetings, and prepared agendas for each meeting. Ken was the timekeeper of the group and made sure that agenda items did not go over time in meetings. Saana had the role of Minutes recorder who took notes for everything discussed in the meeting. Since Sam had a rich background in developing applications and came up with the idea of the project, he took the role of software developer. He provided the core idea of the project with individual research to support it through Gantt Chart (a widely used online project planning platform).


6)  A research summary that highlights the challenges of working within your
chosen domain.

Considering our technical skills, the languages (issues with Python) had to find things that work with p5.js which is pretty limited, also the domain has to work with the heart rate so we’re limited on devices


7) Evidence that compares your project to similar software tools (e.g. market analysis.)
Market analysis in progress

8) A description of your approach that discusses the motivations and reasoning for working in a particular manner (e.g. Agile, User-Centred Design, Test-Driven Development.)
Text

9) Some early prototypes showing how the project will work and highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of your proposition.
Text

10) Some early evidence of assumption testing and validation of your designs to date (e.g. user tests or automated feedback such as W3C validation/accessibility testing, heuristic tests etc.)
We know the libraries we’re utilising work on different similar projects so we know the technologies work on what we are attempting to create.
Assumption testing?
User tests will be done in the second phase of the project once the app is up and running.

Survey
We conducted a survey to find out about users’ preferences when it comes to working out and workout applications. The data collected in the survey is helping us in every stage of the design process and confirming assumptions which we already had about users’ preferences as well as giving us new information.
The survey was taken by 24 people over the age of 18. Some results were expected, for example that people like listening to upbeat music while working out, while others were less predictable. The results made us shift our focus to aspects of the design that the respondents seemed to find more important and sometimes consider some aspects we had not thought of.
Eye-opening findings
Our survey found that:
100% of respondents use workout apps either sometimes (50%) or every time (50%) they work out
music apps are the most popular type of app to use while working out - 80% of our respondents said they use them while working out
nearly three quarters of our respondents feel that the music they listen to is sometimes either too slow paced or too fast for their current workout level
Further results
While music apps were the most popular type of workout app, half of the respondents said they like using heart rate monitoring apps and a third said they like using instructional apps while working out. One sixth went on to clarify that they like listening to podcasts and audiobooks during their workout which was something we had not considered.
The most sought-after qualities in a workout app were ease of use (20 votes) and simplicity (18 votes), followed by customisability (10 votes) and minimalistic user interface (8 votes).
As we had expected, upbeat music was our respondents’ favourite type of music to listen to (18 votes) but there were plenty of other popular genres and types of music. These include intense music (10 votes) and music with lyrics (10 votes), dance music (9 votes) and electronic music (9 votes), and aggressive music (8 votes). A couple of respondents specified that the type of music they listen to while working out depends on their mood and the type of workout.
Most respondents (nearly 60%) said that they feel the need to change music while doing a workout, for example to more intense music to finish that last lap, which is something that could distract or disturb the flow of the workout. This is an issue our app is aiming to minimise.
